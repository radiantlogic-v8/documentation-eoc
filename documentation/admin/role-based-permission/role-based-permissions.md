# Role-based Permissions

The operations a user can perform and what they can view in Environment Operations Center differ based on their assigned role. Env Ops Center has three levels of user roles: Tenant Administrator, Environment Administrator, and Environment User. This guide outlines the permissions for each user role.

The following table provides an overview of user permissions for each role:

|   | [Tenant Administrator](#tenant-administrator) | [Environment Administrator](#environment-administrator) | [Environment User](#environment-user) |
| -- | ------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Environment Details | View and edit all | View and edit assigned environments | View assigned environments |
| User Details | View and edit all | View and edit all users within assigned environments | View user details within assigned environments and can only edit their own details |

## Tenant administrator
