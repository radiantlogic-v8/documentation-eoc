# Getting Started

Environment Operations Center allows you to control your RadiantOne implementation in a cloud environment. It provides all of the required tools to:
 
1. Create and manage RadiantOne [environments](../environments/environment-overview/environments.md) as well as install and manage RadiantOne applications in your environments. 

2. [Securely connect with on-premises data ](../secure-data-connector/configure-sdc-service.md).

3. Observe usage and issues with [reporting](../reporting/reporting-overview.md), [monitoring](../monitoring/monitoring-overview.md), [logging](../environments/logging/environment-logs.md), and [alerting](../environments/environment-details/alert-management-overview.md) dashboards.

4. [Administrate](../admin/admin-overview.md) account settings, users, environment alerts and integrations depending on the user role.  

5. Customize the homepage with widgets and relevant links.  

This guide provides an overview of the Environment Operations Center home screen and how to navigate the user interface of this screen.

## Overview
After logging in to the Environment Operations Center, the *Overview* screen appears. This is the Environment Operations Center home screen. It provides access to Radiant Logic quick links, application status and so on. You can customize the displayed layout of the screen. 

A navigation bar is located to the left and is visible from all screens within Environment Operation Center. You can access your account settings by selecting the avatar in the upper right corner, also visible from all screens in the application. If you are an admin, you can access admin settings by selecting the admin icon in the bottom left corner of the page.
