# Delete an Environment

This guide outlines the required steps to delete an environment while on the *Environments* home screen in Environment Operations Center. For information on deleting an environment from its detailed view, see the [delete an environment from its detailed view](../environment-details/delete-environment.md) guide.

From the *Environments* home screen, locate the environment you would like to delete from the list of environments. Go the specific environment and  on the right top corner, select the ellipsis **(**...**)**, to expand the options available and select **DELETE** from the list.
